### L-System Playground

This is a single page site to experiment with [L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) in 3d.
It was originally created for [Computation Club](http://london.computation.club/) but has evolved since then.
Most of the code is written in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) and compiled to JavaScript.
